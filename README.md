# Array-servlet
Java Servlet for Android application

A Java servlet processes or stores a Java class in Java EE that conforms to the Java Servlet API,[2] a standard for implementing Java classes that respond to requests. Servlets could in principle communicate over any clientâ€“server protocol, but they are most often used with the HTTP protocol. Thus "servlet" is often used as shorthand for "HTTP servlet".[3] Thus, a software developer may use a servlet to add dynamic content to a web server using the Java platform. The generated content is commonly HTML, but may be other data such as XML. Servlets can maintain state in session variables across many server transactions by using HTTP cookies, or URL rewriting.
